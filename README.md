# ML_regression_on_appartments_dataset
This project predicts apartment prices using a multiple linear regression model. Data was cleaned, encoded, scaled, and log-transformed. Relevant features were selected using correlations. The model was validated with k-fold cross-validation and then used to generate final price predictions for unseen properties.

Data preprocessing addressed several challenges, including missing data, heterogeneous variable types, and skewed distributions. Missing values were treated using domain-aware imputation strategies, such as replacing location-dependent variables with neighborhood medians, mode imputation for binary features, and removal of features with excessive missingness. Nominal categorical variables were consolidated by grouping infrequent categories into an “Other” class to prevent sparsity. Several numerical variables exhibited skewness and were transformed using log functions. Additionally, engineered features such as floor-level bins and building year categories were included to better represent structural characteristics.

StandardScaler was applied to continuous variables to normalize ranges before modeling. Ordinal features were encoded based on their inherent rank, while nominal features underwent one-hot encoding, ensuring consistent structure between training and test datasets. Feature selection combined correlation thresholds for numeric variables and the inclusion of meaningful categorical dummies, resulting in a balanced and interpretable final feature set.

A multiple linear regression model was built using the OLS method from statsmodels. The target variable was the natural logarithm of the price, improving linearity and reducing heteroscedasticity. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, computing RMSE on back-transformed predictions to fairly evaluate error in the original pricing scale. After validation, the model was used to predict prices for the test dataset, followed by reversing the log transformation to obtain realistic price estimates.

Finally, predictions were exported as a CSV file suitable for deployment or competition submission. The project demonstrates a complete regression modeling pipeline - from raw data ingestion to statistical modeling, evaluation, and real-world prediction output.
