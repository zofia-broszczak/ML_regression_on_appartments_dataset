# ML_regression_on_appartments_dataset
This project predicts apartment prices using a multiple linear regression model. Data was cleaned, encoded, scaled, and log-transformed. Relevant features were selected using correlations. The model was validated with k-fold cross-validation and then used to generate final price predictions for unseen properties.
